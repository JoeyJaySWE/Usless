# Useless Page

<h2>Description:</h2>
So for this assignment I've been tasked to make a useless page.
So I decided to do something that was the only thing I could find fitting for such a place, throw it in the Bin.
Problem is, my server that is hosting my useless page seams to be running on an old Windows XP for some reason, so it has a tendancy to crash with some Blue Screens of Death...
